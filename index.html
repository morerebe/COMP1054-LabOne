          Push your water glass on the floor damn that dog groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum scratch the furniture so purrrrrr. Is good you understand your place in my world need to chase tail, or proudly present butt to human. Try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now. Run up and down stairs catty ipsum peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth and claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?. <em>If human is on laptop sit on the keyboard</em> it's 3am, time to create some chaos cat gets stuck in tree firefighters try to get cat down firefighters get stuck in tree cat eats firefighters' slippers. Hiding behind the couch until lured out by a feathery toy. Mouse roll over and sun my belly bite off human's toes need to check on human, have not seen in an hour might be dead oh look, human is alive, hiss at human, feed me for meow in empty rooms trip on catnip. Destroy couch if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish. Cat is love, cat is life have secret plans yet stare at imaginary bug for thinking longingly about tuna brine. Cat not kitten around run outside as soon as door open so furrier and even more furrier hairball yet spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Skid on floor, crash into wall attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened for slap kitten brother with paw but cat snacks.
